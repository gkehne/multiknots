# multiknots
###Overview:
Python code written to manipulate [Ã¼ber knots and petal knots](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5742). This came from undergraduate research in hyperbolic knot theory, and it was used for experimental results that appear in Section 3.5 of ["Bipyramid Decompositions of Multi-crossing Link Complements"] (http://unbound.williams.edu/theses/islandora/object/studenttheses%3A126)

###Capabilities currently include:  
* Random generation of uber and petal knots.  
* Calculation of the hyperbolic volumes of knot complements (by interfacing with Jeff Weeks's SnapPy program and associated [snappy](http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/) Python module).  
* Calculation of volume upper bounds derived from the bipyramid decompositions that appear in the research above.
